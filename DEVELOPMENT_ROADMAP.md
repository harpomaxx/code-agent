# Code Agent Development Roadmap

This document outlines the development phases for the ReAct-based code agent, tracking completed work and future enhancements.

## **Completed Phases ✅**

### **Phase 1: Real-time Loop Prevention & Progressive Clarification**
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Components Implemented**:
- `src/agent/loop_detector.py` - Real-time loop detection and prevention
- `src/agent/clarification_manager.py` - Progressive clarification with escalating guidance
- Enhanced `src/agent/react_agent.py` integration

**Key Features**:
- 🔄 Real-time loop detection (identical, alternating, cyclic, parameter loops)
- 📝 Progressive clarification (Basic → Detailed → Simplified)
- 🛡️ Loop prevention before execution (not just detection after timeout)
- ⚡ Alternative action suggestions for detected patterns

**Impact**: Eliminated infinite loops and provided much better guidance when agent gets stuck.

### **Phase 2: Enhanced Recovery & Tool Fallbacks**
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Components Implemented**:
- `src/agent/fallback_strategies.py` - Automatic tool fallback system
- `src/agent/progress_tracker.py` - Dynamic iteration management
- Enhanced ReActAgent with comprehensive recovery

**Key Features**:
- 🔄 Automatic tool fallback strategies (edit_file → write_file, etc.)
- ⚡ Smart retry logic with exponential backoff
- 📊 Dynamic iteration management (base 10 → up to 25 based on complexity)
- ✅ Early success detection
- 📈 Progress-based timeout extensions
- 🎯 Comprehensive progress analysis

**Impact**: Significantly reduced actual failures through intelligent recovery, not just better reporting.

### **Memory Fix: Conversation Continuity in Chat Mode**
**Status**: ✅ Complete

**Components Enhanced**:
- `src/agent/memory.py` - ConversationMemory integration
- `src/agent/react_agent.py` - Dual memory management modes
- `src/cli/commands.py` - Chat mode with memory commands

**Key Features**:
- 💬 Chat mode: Conversation memory enabled, continuity preserved
- 📝 Ask mode: No memory, each request independent (backward compatible)
- 🔧 Separate task state vs conversation state management
- 📊 New chat commands: `clear`, `history`
- 🎯 Natural conversation flow with context preservation

**Impact**: Resolved critical memory issue - agent now has natural conversation continuity instead of goldfish memory.
